Recursion

1. In your own words, what is Recursion?
	When a function calls itself to complete a certain tesk. 
2. Why is it necessary to have a Base Case?
	A base case is like a checker that will check if a condition is or is not met. If the condition has not yet been met, the recursion will continue.

Graphs

1. What is a Graph?
	Graphs are similar to trees except they can have cycles. The relationships in a tree can be directed or non-directed. 
2. How is a Graph different from a Tree?
	Trees have a hierarchy and graphs do not. 
3. Give an example of somthing that would be good to model with a Graph.
	Friendship relationships

Sorting

1. Describe in words how the Bubble Sort algorithm works.
	After the first pass through the list, the biggest number will be all the way to the right. After the second pass, the second highest number will be second from the right, and so on.
2. Describe in words how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
	Start with two sorted lists. Initialize new, empty list for results. Compare first element of each sorted list. Remove whichever element is lower and add it to the results list. Continue comparing 1st elements of each list until a list is empty. Append the remaining items from the other list to results list. 
3. Describe in words how the Quick Sort algorithm works.
	Operates in O(nlogn) but in place. Works as a partition where there is a pivot and you can move all the numbers lower than the pivot number to the beginning of the list and move all the numbers bigger than the pivot to the right of the pivot number.

Git Branching

1. Give an instance when you would use git branching.
	When you would want to safely test an idea so that you may work on the main branch safely. 

2. What is a pull request?
	A pull request is a GitHub specific feature that allows a user to check their branch and merge it to another branch.
